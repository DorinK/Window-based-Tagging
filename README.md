# Window-based-Tagging
Second assignment in Deep Learning course

In this assignment i used a framework that supports auto-diff (computation- graph, backprop) in order to compute gradients, and implement a sequence tagger with window-based features.

I experimented with word pre-trained embeddings, and with different word representations, on two different tagging tasks.
